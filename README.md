# next-localstorage-blog
A blog created with Next.js and localStorage.

## built with a framework
I choose to use a framework instead of just using React on the front end because i want to use a framework as a tool to access the database so that users can log into my blog application and store their data.

## Why i chose this framework?
I chose this framework because i read through the documentation on Reacts website itself, I chose 2 that would be a fit for my blog:
1. Next.js
2. gatsby

I went with the Next.js because:
1. It is more commonly used.
2. it supports more commonly used SQL instead of gatsby that supports GraphQL data layer.
